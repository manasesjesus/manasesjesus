    One chill, groovy, bubbly, witty, cheeky, friendly neighborhood S̷p̷i̷d̷e̷r̷m̷a̷n̷ Mexican.
    No bad habits, quite smart, fantastic and wonderful gentleman. Sometimes modest and very humble.
    <!-- Friends say I'm funny. My parents and J. Blunt say I'm beautiful. LMFAO band says I'm sexy and I know it. -->
    Good manners, well behaved, seldom naughty. I like chocolates, Mexican food
    (tacos, tlayudas, chilaquiles), hugs and sleeping 8+ hours.
